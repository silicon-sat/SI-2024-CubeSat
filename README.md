# Lab Exercises

- **Lab 1: Intro to ESP32 Programming**
  - Install and configure Arduino IDE
  - Introduction to ESP32 development kit.
  - Write and execute a C-code to blink an LED on the dev board.

- **Lab 2: Intro to GPIO programming**
  - In this Lab exercise, students learn to configure a GPIO as an output and control an LED with it.

- **Lab 3: Dimming LED using PWM**
  - In this exercise we are going to use the ESP32 to control the light intensity of an external LED using PWM signal.
  - From the [LED Datasheet](docs/Datasheet-LED-XLMR01DE.pdf) tabulate the following data:
    - Maximum Forward current (If)
    - Typical Forward Voltage (Vf)
    - Dominant Wavelength (lambdaD)
    - Estimate the color (RGB) from the above wavelength
    - Typical Cacpacitance (pF)
    - Operating temperature range
  - From the [ESP32 Datasheet](docs/Datasheet-ESP32.pdf) find and tabulate:
    - the maximum output voltage of the GPIO pins, and
    - the maximum current that the GPIO can source from supply to the load.
  - Calculate the value of the resistance to pass _half of the Maximum_ forward current (If) when ON.
    - Make sure this current can be sourced by the output port.
  - Find the closest *E12* standardized resistors value available in the market to use for the above limiter.
    - See this [guide](https://eepower.com/resistor-guide/resistor-standards-and-codes/resistor-values/#) on resistor standardization.
  - Calculate the maximum frequency you can switch the LED such that, the RC time-constant of the LED-cap-resitor is at least 1/25 of the switching period.
  - Find out what is the minimum frequency you can switch the LED.
  - Decide on a frequency which is safely in between the minimum and maximum.
  - Write a program for ESP32:
    - Assign an output port for the LED
    - Assign an input port for 2-step dimmer control.
      - 1: Full intensity, 0: 25-percent intensity.
    - Write a program to control the LED intensity using Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM).
    
- **Lab 4: Dimming multiple LEDs**
  - ESP32 GPIO pins were used to dim multiiple LEDs with different delays.

- **Lab 5: Printing data in the serial monitor**
  - The **Serial Monitor** is an essential tool when creating projects with Arduino. It can be used as a debugging tool, testing concepts, or communicating directly with the Arduino board.
  - The **Arduino IDE 2** has the Serial Monitor tool integrated with the editor, which means that no external window is opened when using the Serial Monitor. This means that you can have multiple windows open, each with its own Serial Monitor.

- **Lab 6: Controlling an LED through serial monitor**
  - Controlling an LED connected to ESP32 by reading commands from the serial monitor and turning the LED on or off based on those commands. 

- **Lab 7: I2C-based OLED Display control**
  - I2C-based OLED pin details. Importing OLED libraries. Structure of the OLED. Displaying simple Text and Scrolling Text in different ways.

- **Lab 8: Introduction Signal Processing using Python**
  - You can use [lab1-fft.py](Labs/python/lab1-fft.py) and [lab2-fsk.py](Labs/python/lab2-fsk.py) as reference for the following exercises:
  - Write a python program to create a _cosine wave_ of frequency `2MHz` with `256` samples per cycle.
  - Plot it with proper annonation and axis labeling. 
  - Compute the `FFT` of the above signal and plot it.
    - You will notice the FFT resolution is very limited for a single cycle.
  - Create another a signal of frequency `3MHz`, add it to above signal and do `FFT` for the resultant signal.
  - Simulate [lab2-fsk.py](Labs/python/lab2-fsk.py) and anlayze the plot to understand FSK modulation.
    - Change the code such that the modulation frequency for `1` is `4MHz` and for `0` it is `3MHz`.
  - Change the above code to simulate ASK modulation.
  - Add demodulation to the above code and plot the time-domain waveform, as well as the FFT of the demodulated signal.
  - Add a moving average filter to remove the high-frequency component from the demodulated signal.

During the tenure of the course, we will learn many fundamental signal processing concepts that is best practiced using the Python programming/scripting language. We will WSL for that purpose. Python language is not a prereq, the basic programming structures will be provided to you.
  - After updating your linux distro, install the following packages:
  - `sudo apt install pip -y`
  - `pip install numpy scipy matplotlib`
- Create a [GitHub](https://github.com) account if you don't have one already. We will use it for multiple purpose: for submission Lab assignment, documenting your Labs and final projec and keeping a revision control repository of all your work during the course work.
