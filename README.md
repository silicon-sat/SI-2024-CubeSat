# Lab Info

## Requirements

- Download and install the latest version (2.3.2+) [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). Majority of the Lab activity will be writing `C Programming Language` for the ESP 32 platform which we will develop using the Arduino IDE.
- Download and install [4NEC2](https://www.qsl.net/4nec2/), antenna modeling and simulation softwware. The antenna design and simulation will be done using this sofware.
- Install [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://github.com/silicon-vlsi-org/eda-wsl2) with Ubuntu 22.04 Linux Distro. In this instruction page, **OMIT** the installation of EDA tools. During the tenure of the course, we will learn many fundamental signal processing concepts that is best practiced using the Python programming/scripting language. We will WSL for that purpose. Python language is not a prereq, the basic programming structures will be provided to you. 

## Lab Resources

- [Ai Thinker's LoRa Radio Module RA-02](AiThinkerRA02.md) is RF radio module based on the Semtech's SX127X transceiver chip. This module will be used for all the satellite communication Lab exercises as well as the [tinyGS](https://tinygs.com) ground station. This page provides the basic information about the module.
