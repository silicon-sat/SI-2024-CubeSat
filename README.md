## Lab 5: Introduction Signal Processing using Python

- You can use [lab1-fft.py](Labs/python/lab1-fft.py) and [lab2-fsk.py](Labs/python/lab2-fsk.py) as reference for the following exercises:
- Write a python program to create a _cosine wave_ of frequency `2MHz` with `256` samples per cycle.
- Plot it with proper annonation and axis labeling. 
- Compute the `FFT` of the above signal and plot it.
  - You will notice the FFT resolution is very limited for a single cycle.
- Create another a signal of frequency `3MHz`, add it to above signal and do `FFT` for the resultant signal.
- Simulate [lab2-fsk.py](Labs/python/lab2-fsk.py) and anlayze the plot to understand FSK modulation.
  - Change the code such that the modulation frequency for `1` is `4MHz` and for `0` it is `3MHz`.
- Change the above code to simulate ASK modulation.
- Add demodulation to the above code and plot the time-domain waveform, as well as the FFT of the demodulated signal.
- Add a moving average filter to remove the high-frequency component from the demodulated signal.

## Lab 4: I2C-based OLED Display control.

In this Lab students learnt to use a I2C-based OLED display to display data on it.


## Lab 3: Dimming LED using PWM

In this exercise we are going to use the ESP32 to control the light intensity of an external LED using PWM signal.

- From the [LED Datasheet](docs/Datasheet-LED-XLMR01DE.pdf) tabulate the following data:
  - Maximum Forward current (If)
  - Typical Forward Voltage (Vf)
  - Dominant Wavelength (lambdaD)
  - Estimate the color (RGB) from the above wavelength
  - Typical Cacpacitance (pF)
  - Operating temperature range
- From the [ESP32 Datasheet](docs/Datasheet-ESP32.pdf) find and tabulate:
  - the maximum output voltage of the GPIO pins, and
  - the maximum current that the GPIO can source from supply to the load.
- Calculate the value of the resistance to pass _half of the Maximum_ forward current (If) when ON.
  - Make sure this current can be sourced by the output port.
- Find the closest *E12* standardized resistors value available in the market to use for the above limiter.
  - See this [guide](https://eepower.com/resistor-guide/resistor-standards-and-codes/resistor-values/#) on resistor standardization.
- Calculate the maximum frequency you can switch the LED such that, the RC time-constant of the LED-cap-resitor is at least 1/25 of the switching period.
- Find out what is the minimum frequency you can switch the LED.
- Decide on a frequency which is safely in between the minimum and maximum.
- Write a program for ESP32:
  - Assign an output port for the LED
  - Assign an input port for 2-step dimmer control.
    - 1: Full intensity, 0: 25-percent intensity.
  - Write a program to control the LED intensity using Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM).
    
## Lab 2: Intro to GPIO programming.

In this Lab exercise, students learn to configure a GPIO as an output and control an LED with it.

## Lab 1: Intro to ESP32 Programming 

- Install and configure Arduino IDE
- Introduction to ESP32 development kit.
- Write and execute a C-code to blink an LED on the dev board.


# Lab Info

## Requirements

- Download and install the latest version (**2.3.2+**) [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). Majority of the Lab activity will be writing `C Programming Language` for the ESP 32 platform which we will develop using the Arduino IDE.
  - [Installing the ESP32 boards](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-esp32-arduino-ide-2-0/)
- Download and install [4NEC2](https://www.qsl.net/4nec2/), antenna modeling and simulation softwware. The antenna design and simulation will be done using this sofware.
- Install [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://github.com/silicon-vlsi-org/eda-wsl2) with **Ubuntu 22.04 Linux Distro** (**OMIT** instruction related to EDA tools). During the tenure of the course, we will learn many fundamental signal processing concepts that is best practiced using the Python programming/scripting language. We will WSL for that purpose. Python language is not a prereq, the basic programming structures will be provided to you.
  - After updating your linux distro, install the following packages:
  - `sudo apt install pip -y`
  - `pip install numpy scipy matplotlib`
- Create a [GitHub](https://github.com) account if you don't have one already. We will use it for multiple purpose: for submission Lab assignment, documenting your Labs and final projec and keeping a revision control repository of all your work during the course work.
